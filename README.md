# Kompakt

Kompakt is a data compression tool designed to squeeze the most compression out of your files while minimizing the drain on your computer's resources. Unlike other programs that might sacrifice compression for speed or ease of use, Kompakt prioritizes maximizing the compression ratio while still being relatively efficient in terms of CPU and memory usage.

Also intended to be the go version of [cmix](https://github.com/byronknoll/cmix) 

## Compression size Goals
- 100MB (~10% of 1GB)
- 10MB (~1% of 1GB)
- 1MB (~0.10% of 1GB)

**Questions:**

- How to reverse a hash data to its original form?
- Would the mixture of encoding algorithms such as Shannon, huffman, and Lempel-Ziv give a middle-out compression algorithm?

**Algorithms:**

- Shannon
- Huffman
- Lempel-Ziv
- Prediction by Partial Matching (PPM)


## Basic Benchmark Goal
 - Use the one from [Hutter Prize](http://prize.hutter1.net/) => might be too ambitious
